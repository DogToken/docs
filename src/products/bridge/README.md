## What is Bridge?

Mist Bridge allows users to easily convert from many popular cryptocurrencies to and from smartBCH.


### Fee Structure

Users are charged between 0.1% and 1.1% fee per transaction, depending on if it utilizes just BCH <-> smartBCH, or external assets.

For non-BCH bridging, 0.3% of the total amount bridged is used to reward xMIST holders, and 0.2% is used for ongoing maintenance, development, and support costs.
