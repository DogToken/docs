## MistSwap Governance

MistSwap aims to be a community-led decentralized effort to bring the maximum utility to smartBCH and grow the ecosystem. To achieve this, investors in MistSwap have a say in upgrading and expanding the protocols and products we launch. Currently MistSwap is still relatively centralized in it's governance, but we are working towards gradually moving ownership over to a DAO.
